## Introduction
ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m @Resuffid, a psychology student from Poland\
I'm interested in many things, but I'm on GitHub because I was told it would be a great tool to became a modern scientist, so why don't give it a try?\
\
Probably, right now, at the beginning of my story, I am aiming to create text files, simple presentations and simple statistical analyses.
Maybe it will turn out that this is my cup of tea, who knows? ;p
